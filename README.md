# ScanScan

Tiny utility that "improves" the scanner.

Really it only removes the need to do a next line after non-string inputs...

## How to use
Import it as a library to your project or copy ![this file](https://github.com/SvenWollinger/ScanScan/blob/main/src/main/java/io/wollinger/ScanScan.java) into your project and call it like "ScanScan.nextInt();"
